# Relations

## study and used drug

There are 29,428 edges between studies and the drugs used in the study. This relation indicates which drugs are used in the study. The used drugs are the drugs found in the intervention or group title/description of the study.

1. id: Study::UsedDrug::0
2. label: study::usedDrug
3. from: StudyID:NCT00000378
4. to: DrugID:85

## Study and studied drug

There are 23,308 edges between studies and studied drugs. This relation indicates which drugs are studied in the study. The studied drugs are the drugs only from the group title/description of the study. All the studied drugs are also used drugs.

1. id: Study::StudiedDrug::0
2. label: study::studiedDrug
3. from: StudyID:NCT00000378
4. to: DrugID:85

## Study and Condition

There are 17,259 edges between studies and conditions. This relation indicates the conditions studied in the study.

1. id: Study::Condition::0
2. label: study::condition
3. from: StudyID:NCT02761980
4. to: ConditionID:0

## Drug and standard term

There are 4,617 edges between drug and standard term. One drug is associated with a drug name. Since multiple drug names may be for the same standard drug. We normalize the drug names with the standard terms.

1. id: drug::term:0
2. label: drug::term
3. from: DrugID:0
4. to: TermID:0



**Note: ** in the database, each relation will have an inverse relation to make the edge double directed. For example, between the study A and condition B, we will have an edge A->B with label Study::Condition and an edge B->A with label Condition::Study. Relations have the same attributes and statistics (e.g., number of edges in the relation) with their inverse relation.
